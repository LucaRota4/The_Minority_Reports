# The Minority Report

The Minority Report is an on-chain voting game that flips democracy on its head—the minority wins. Powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on Ethereum, every vote remains completely secret until the reveal, creating a psychological game where thinking differently pays off. Players must predict what others won't choose, making it a fascinating experiment in game theory and human behavior. Complete anonymity means no one can prove how you voted, forcing pure strategic thinking over social pressure. This monorepo contains both the smart contracts and the frontend application.

  ### Acknowledgement

  This code is heavily inspired by Elio Margiotta’s GitHub repository and his Agora application.
The goal was to reuse the same logic and structure while adapting them to an online game.
Because I believed the contest deadline was December 31st, this project is not yet a fully finished or polished version.
