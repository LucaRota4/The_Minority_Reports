# Introduction

Agora is the first on-chain election platform that ensures complete vote privacy while preserving freedom of speech. Built on Ethereum with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), it enables secure, anonymous voting in decentralized governance spaces.

## What is Agora?

Agora is a privacy-first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform that revolutionizes governance through cryptography. Using Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Agora allows communities to make collective decisions where votes remain encrypted throughout the process, ensuring anonymity while maintaining verifiability.

## How It Works

### 1. Create Your Agora Space
Connect your wallet and establish a private DAO space with customizable rules and member roles for your community.

### 2. Invite Your Community
Share access with members, assign permissions, and build your governance community within your Agora space.

### 3. Create a Private Proposal
Design proposals with flexible voting models (weighted/unweighted), eligibility criteria (token holders, NFT holders, or public), and decision thresholds.

### 4. Vote Anonymously, Reveal Verifiable Results
Cast encrypted votes using FHE technology. Chainlink automation handles the tally and publishes outcomes without revealing individual choices.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Powered Governance**: Run DAO logic on encrypted data—decisions stay public, votes stay private
- **Kryptē Psêphos**: Anonymous voting with verifiable outcomes and end-to-end encryption
- **Seamless Customization**: Choose voting parameters, privacy levels, and governance models
- **Chainlink Proposal Automation**: Time-based proposal flows and trustless execution

## Getting Started

To start using Agora, visit the platform and connect your Web3 wallet. For developers interested in the technical implementation, see the [Core](core.md) and [Frontend](frontend.md) documentation.
