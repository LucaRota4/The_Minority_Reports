# Agora Documentation

## Overview

Agora is a revolutionary privacy-preserving governance platform that leverages Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to enable truly anonymous and secure decentralized governance. Built on Ethereum-compatible blockchains, Agora allows communities to create private DAO spaces where members can submit proposals and vote anonymously while maintaining full verifiability of outcomes.

## Purpose

The core purpose of Agora is to democratize governance by solving the fundamental privacy paradox in decentralized systems: how to maintain transparency in decision-making while protecting individual voter privacy. Traditional DAOs often require sacrificing anonymity for accountability, but Agora uses cutting-edge cryptography to provide both.

### Key Problems Solved
- **Privacy vs. Transparency Trade-off**: FHE enables computation on encrypted data, allowing vote tallying without ever decrypting individual ballots
- **Voter Intimidation**: Anonymous voting prevents coercion and ensures free expression
- **Sybil Attacks**: Token-based eligibility systems prevent manipulation while maintaining privacy
- **Scalability**: Efficient encrypted computation enables large-scale governance without performance degradation

## What You Can Do

### For Community Leaders
- **Create Governance Spaces**: Set up custom DAO environments with configurable rules and member roles
- **Define Voting Models**: Choose between weighted/unweighted voting, set quorum requirements, and eligibility criteria
- **Manage Membership**: Invite members, assign permissions, and control access to your governance space

### For Community Members
- **Submit Proposals**: Create and submit governance proposals with rich text descriptions and attachments
- **Vote Anonymously**: Cast encrypted votes that remain private throughout the process
- **Track Outcomes**: View verifiable results and proposal statuses in real-time
- **Participate Securely**: Engage in governance without revealing your identity or voting preferences

### For Developers
- **Build on FHE**: Use Agora's infrastructure to create privacy-preserving dApps
- **Integrate Governance**: Add anonymous voting capabilities to existing platforms
- **Customize Workflows**: Extend the platform with custom proposal types and voting mechanisms

## How It Works

### 1. Create Your Agora Space
Connect your Web3 wallet and establish a new governance space with custom parameters:
- Joining eligibility (token holders, NFT owners, or public access)

### 2. Invite Your Community
Share access with community members and assign appropriate roles:
- Owner: Full control over space settings
- Admin: Can create new proposals
- Member: Can participate in voting
- Observer: Read-only access to proposals and results

### 3. Create Private Proposals
Submit governance proposals with complete privacy guarantees:
- Rich text descriptions and multimedia attachments
- Configurable voting periods and parameters
- Automated workflow management via Chainlink

### 4. Vote Anonymously, Reveal Verifiable Results
Participate in governance with full privacy:
- Cast encrypted votes using FHE technology
- Maintain anonymity throughout the voting process
