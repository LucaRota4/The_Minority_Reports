# AGORA Voting and Resolution Test Summary

This document summarizes the test suite for the AGORA private proposal system, focusing on voting mechanisms and resolution logic implemented in `test/voting-resolution.ts`.

## Test Overview

The test suite covers all major voting types and resolution scenarios using Hardhat and the FHEVM plugin for encrypted computations. Tests are structured around different proposal types and edge cases.

- Covers creation, authorization, and ownership changes.

### ✅ SpaceRegistry Tests (47 passing)
**Description**: Comprehensive tests for space creation, management, membership, and administration.
- Includes space lifecycle, membership types (public, whitelist, token/NFT holder), admin functions.

### ✅ PrivateProposalFactory Tests (20 passing)
**Description**: Tests proposal factory deployment, creation, management, and Chainlink Automation integration.
- Covers proposal lifecycle, validation, and upkeep detection/performance.

### ✅ PrivateProposal Voting and Resolution Tests (14 passing)

**Tests Performed**:
- **User Voting**: Verifies users can vote with encrypted choices (passes).
- **Double Voting Prevention**: Ensures users cannot vote twice (passes).
- **Proposal Resolution**: Tests end-to-end resolution with correct winner determination (passes).

**Expected Behavior**: 2 votes for "Yes", 1 for "No" → "Yes" wins via plurality.

### ✅ Weighted Single Choice Voting
**Description**: Tests voting weighted by token balance, where full voting power goes to one choice.

**Tests Performed**:
- **Weighted Voting**: Verifies voting power calculation based on token holdings (passes).
- **Resolution**: Tests correct tallying and winner selection (passes).

**Expected Behavior**: User1 (1000 tokens) votes "Yes", User2 (2000 tokens) votes "No" → "No" wins with 2000 votes.

### ✅ Weighted Fractional Voting
**Description**: Tests voting where users distribute their voting power across multiple choices using percentages.

**Tests Performed**:
- **Fractional Voting**: Verifies percentage-based vote splitting (passes).
- **Resolution**: Tests correct accumulation and winner determination (passes).

**Expected Behavior**:
- User1 (1000 tokens): 60% A, 30% B, 10% C → 600 A, 300 B, 100 C
- User2 (2000 tokens): 20% A, 50% B, 30% C → 400 A, 1000 B, 600 C
- Total: 1000 A, 1300 B, 700 C → "B" wins

### ✅ Voting with Abstain Option
**Description**: Tests proposals that include an "Abstain" choice, which is excluded from winner calculations.

**Tests Performed**:
- **Abstain Inclusion**: Verifies abstain is added as the last choice (passes).
- **Abstain Exclusion**: Ensures abstain votes don't affect the outcome (passes).

**Expected Behavior**: 1 "Yes", 1 "Abstain" → "Yes" wins (abstain ignored).

### ✅ Passing Threshold Logic
**Description**: Tests threshold-based passing (50% required) and draw handling.

**Tests Performed**:
- **Draw Handling**: Verifies tie scenarios result in no winner (passes).

**Expected Behavior**: 2 "Yes", 2 "No" with 50% threshold → Draw (neither exceeds 50%).

## Overall Test Status
- **All Tests Pass**: 85/85 tests passing with no failures.
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of ENS, spaces, proposals, voting, and automation.

## Limitations and Considerations

### FHE Testing Environment
- **Test-Only Decryption**: Uses `fhevm.publicDecrypt()` for testing. In production, decryption occurs off-chain via Zama's FHE service.
- **Mock Dependencies**: Relies on mock contracts (MockENS, MockGovernanceToken) for ENS and token functionality.
- **Local Network**: Tests run on Hardhat's local network with FHEVM plugin; may not reflect mainnet gas costs or timing.

### Resolution Process
- **Manual Resolution**: Tests simulate the full resolution flow, but in production, `resolveProposalCallback` requires off-chain decryption results.
- **Timing**: Tests advance time artificially; real proposals depend on Chainlink Automation for timely upkeep.
- **Zero Votes**: Not explicitly tested; may require special handling if no votes are cast (proposal might not resolve or pass).

### Security and Edge Cases
- **Not Covered**: Denial-of-service via invalid proofs, gas limits on large proposals, or malicious FHE inputs.
- **Assumptions**: Assumes valid FHE proofs and correct oracle responses; does not test proof verification failures.
